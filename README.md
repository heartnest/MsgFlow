A Study of Message flow in a multilayer network using Netlogo
==================


In this project, we study information flow in a 2-layer network which contains 2 parts:

1) Gossip algorithm on a 2-layer network

2) Simple social network, where people forward the message in base of their interest towards the message,
the interest is distributed randomly and we conduct the experiment changing the interes-threshold.

It is found that:

1) average similarity of neighbors of a multilayer network and layer interaction have a strong efficiency impact on the performance
of gossip algorithm.

2) the group of particullarly interested people contribute to the robustness of network
where interested people are few.
